  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Carbon Car</strong> (“the App”) handles information when you use it.
    We respect your privacy and are committed to being transparent about our practices.
  </p>

  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> collect personal information like your name, email, or phone number within the App.</li>
    <li>The App may collect <em>non-personal</em> data (e.g., device information, performance metrics, crash logs) to improve stability and gameplay.</li>
    <li>If advertising or analytics services are enabled, they may process data according to their own policies (see “Third‑Party Services” below).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Information We Process</h2>
  <h3>Information you provide</h3>
  <p>The App does not require you to create an account or submit personal details to play.</p>

  <h3>Automatically collected information</h3>
  <p>When you use the App, limited technical information may be collected automatically, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Device type, operating system version, language, and country/region (as provided by the OS).</li>
    <li>App interactions (e.g., screens visited, session duration), performance data, and crash logs.</li>
    <li>Anonymous identifiers used by the platform (e.g., Google Play Services) to support basic app operations.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This data is used to maintain and improve the App, diagnose issues, and prevent fraud.</p>

  <h2>Advertising</h2>
  <p>
    The App may display ads outside core gameplay (e.g., in menus). Advertising partners may use
    mobile identifiers to deliver and measure ads. You can reset or limit ad tracking in your device settings.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Android</strong>: Settings &gt; Google &gt; Ads (or “Privacy” &gt; “Ads”) to reset the advertising ID or opt out of ads personalization.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Third‑Party Services</h2>
  <p>We may integrate the following services (some or all may be present depending on the build/version):</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Google Play Services</strong> – Essential services for Android apps. See: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Google AdMob</strong> (Advertising) – See: <a href="https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AdMob Policy &amp; Privacy</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Google Firebase</strong> (Analytics/Crash Reporting) – See: <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Firebase Privacy &amp; Security</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Unity</strong> (Engine and optional services) – See: <a href="https://unity.com/legal/privacy-policy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Unity Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Please review the linked policies to understand how these providers handle data.</p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
    If you believe a child has provided personal information, please contact us and we will delete it.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Retention</h2>
  <p>Non‑personal analytics and crash data are retained only as long as necessary for the purposes described above, after which they are aggregated or deleted.</p>

  <h2>Your Choices</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You can uninstall the App at any time to stop all data collection by the App.</li>
    <li>Manage analytics/ads permissions via your device settings (notifications, network access, advertising ID, etc.).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>International Transfers</h2>
  <p>
    Third‑party providers may process data on servers located in different countries. By using the App, you consent
    to such processing in accordance with their policies.
  </p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect information. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

  <h2>GDPR/CCPA/UK Users</h2>
  <p>
    Depending on your region, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing of your data.
